# Don't Forget To Water!

## Sometimes watering your plants is hard.

Keep your beloved flora alive by finding creative ways to terraform the world around you — and giving them the liquid gold (water!) they deserve.

This game was made for Ludum Dare 46: Keep it alive! All assets, including music, sound effects, art, and code, was made by myself during the 48 hours of the event — with the exception of the Alegreya font.

I wouldn't recommend you try to learn anything from the source because I was pressed for time and the code is ugly.

Note: there are some bugs. If you find a way to route your water off the edge of the map the game will crash. I'm sure there are also other bugs. Please report them if you find them!
